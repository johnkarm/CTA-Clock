# CTA-Alarm-Clock

Using Googleâ€™s Fused Location API to currently design an app to ring when arriving at your train stop to wake user from sleep. I got the idea from the many times my friends and I have fallen asleep on a train in Chicago and missed our spot. Working on this app has been a great way to expand my knowledge in App Development, Permissions, Java, and XML layouts 

*****THIS APP IS CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS AND NOT READY FOR USE*****

Ambitions: I hope to finish the app and then expand it to work for all train stops on the Chicago 'L

Below is an image of the app:
